Comprehensive analysis of pollution levels and their impact on public health in major U.S. cities
# Comprehensive Pollution Analysis in Urban U.S. Cities and Its Impact on Public Health

### **Introduction**
Urban areas in the United States face increasing levels of pollution, posing significant risks to public health. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of multiple pollution types, such as air, water, noise, and waste, and correlate them with public health outcomes in major U.S. cities. The goal is to identify key pollution-related health risks and provide actionable insights that can inform public policy and improve urban living conditions.

### **Why Did We Choose This Project?**
Pollution in urban environments is a growing concern, especially in highly populated cities where multiple forms of pollution coexist. This project aims to investigate how different pollution types affect health outcomes like respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease, and mental health conditions. Understanding these impacts through a data-driven approach is essential for designing better public health interventions and environmental policies.

### **What Problem Are We Solving?**
We are addressing the lack of a comprehensive analysis that considers the cumulative effects of multiple pollution types on public health. While air pollution is often studied alone, urban populations are exposed to various pollution sources simultaneously. Our analysis will explore correlations between these pollutants and different health outcomes to provide a clearer understanding of the public health challenges in urban U.S. cities.

### **What Is the Impact of the Project?**
This project has the potential to influence public health and environmental policies by identifying the most harmful pollution sources in specific urban areas. The results of this analysis will help policymakers, healthcare professionals, and environmental advocates prioritize interventions to reduce pollution-related health risks in cities most affected by pollution.

### **Dataset Source**
To be determined (TBD). The dataset will likely include environmental pollution data from public sources such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and health records from public health databases.

### **Why This Dataset?**
We will choose a dataset that provides a broad range of pollution indicators (air, water, noise, etc.) alongside public health data, allowing us to conduct a comprehensive analysis. The dataset's scope and reliability will play a critical role in the accuracy and effectiveness of our study.

### **What Methodologies Will You Use?**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We will conduct an initial investigation of the dataset to identify patterns, anomalies, and relationships between variables.
- **Correlation Analysis:** To determine the strength and direction of relationships between different types of pollution and health outcomes.
- **Regression Models:** We will use linear and logistic regression models to predict health risks based on pollution levels.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Mapping of pollution and health data to visualize which urban areas are most affected.
- **Data Visualization:** Heatmaps, scatter plots, and other visuals to make the data easier to interpret and communicate.

### **What Is Your Expected Outcome?**
We expect to establish strong correlations between pollution levels and various health outcomes across U.S. cities. The study will likely identify key pollutants (such as particulate matter, noise pollution, and waste mismanagement) that significantly impact health outcomes like respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease, and mortality rates. Additionally, we aim to highlight which cities and populations are most at risk and provide recommendations for targeted pollution control measures.
